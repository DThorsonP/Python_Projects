Various projects I've been working on lately to get better at programming in Python.

Hi I'm David,  I started in tech about 8 years eager to bein a new chapter in both my personal and professional lives.
From an early age I've enjoyed working with computers but hadn't considered it a career until I realized I'd be more fulfilled
if I found a way turn my hoppy into a means to help others in the marketplace.
